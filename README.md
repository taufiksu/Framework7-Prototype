# Framework7 Prototype

Simple yet effective **Framework7 Prototype** for **Visual Studio Code** ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)). This extension help to start make prototype with Framework7.

## Idea

Inspired from [Framework7](https://framework7.io/docs/) documentation. I thought it would be great if we have only [Framework7](https://framework7.io/) project starter inside **Visual Studio Code** ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)),so created it.
